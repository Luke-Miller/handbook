## Tips
### Don't use DM's for Conversations

DM: Direct Message

You can DM through tools such as Slack or YouTrack, the recipient will get immediate notification of your DM. If you are already engaged in a DM conversation with someone as you both have each others attention.

#### Options

* Move to a face-to-face meeting
* Move to Google Hangouts

### Don't use DM's for Prompts

If you @ someone in YouTrack you will be immediately notifying the recipient of your comment. Consider this to be the same as walking up to someone, tapping them on the shoulder and delivering your message.

This can result in a context switch and unless the recipient should have been notified immediately it is likely that you've interrupted them with something that can be delivered later for when that person is free.

#### Options

* If the recipient needs to know about it now, then it would be acceptable.
* If you need an answer to your question, then consider blocking the issue and asking it at the next scheduled meeting.
