# Vocabulary

On the whole, we have a dislike for most buzzwords. So if you're looking for a place where _DYNAMIC SYNERGY_ during _CRUNCH TIME_ is how you _KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK, YO_, this likely isn't the place for you.

We try and make sure that we use language that isn't too full of technical jargon where it can be avoided. We generally don't want to use abbreviations a lot (especially with newcomers). However like most other companies and organisations in the world, Viva IT has a vocabulary that's developed internally to refer to our products, processes, tools and techniques.

## CU

**[Credit Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union):** TLDR: "A credit union is a member-owned financial cooperative, controlled by its members and operated on the principle of people helping people, providing its members credit at competitive rates as well as other financial services."

## RTM

**[Release to master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_to_manufacturing_(RTM)):** We use this to describe a pull request to release features that have been merged in to the develop branch, into master. Typically with our products, when something's in the master branch and tests pass, it'll deploy to production automatically.

## PP 

**Planning Poker:** While typically done in the fashion described [here](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker) - ours is slightly different. We don't stick to set story points, because we use hours to estimate tasks. Therefore we each estimate how long a task will take, and keep our estimate secret until revealing it once everyone has one. Through this, we will then either discuss the times (if there's a wide variance in high & low time estimates) or generally pick the higher estimate if the estimates are all fairly similar. For example, if 2 people say 4 hours and one person says 5, we might discuss it and either could be valid. But if 2 people say 5 hours and one person says 4, we'll likely pick 5 hours.
