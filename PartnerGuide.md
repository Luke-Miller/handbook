### Email based Helpdesk for service issues

Viva IT operates an IT support Helpdesk team accessible only via email, at helpdesk@vivait.co.uk 

Unlimited access to this email-based Helpdesk is included for all Apollo partners to report bugs and service issues. Helpdesk is not available directly to your members or customers. 

This email address is monitored by the same UK based development team who created Apollo. who are experienced in issue diagnosis and remediation. 

To help your team submit comprehensive issue descriptions, please ensure they:

* Include one or more relevant screenshots.
* Include details of the issue in question such as member number, dates, times, exact wordings of messages.
* Describe the issue as specifically and precisely as possible.

Two illustrative example Helpdesk issues follow, the first a poor example and the second a more comprehensive example:

"A member has called up and said the balance on their account is wrong."

"Member 123456 logged on to the mobile app from their android device at approximately 10am, and saw a balance in their savings account of £100, which we don't recognise as our back office states it should be £200. Please see two attached screenshots, one from the member showing the £100 and one from our back office showing the £200.".

Once you email helpdesk@vivait.co.uk you will receive an automatic acknowledgement. Please send any responses on the same issue back as a reply.  Please do not email a fresh email about an existing issue or two unconnected tickets will be raised.

Any email addresses CC'ed in on the initial email to Helpdesk will receive all subsequent updates.

### Viva IT Incident/Outage Status Webpage

We recommend all Apollo partners subscribe to incident notifications at: https://status.vivait.co.uk/

This can be done by clicking the envelope icon in the top right of that web page and entering your email address.

We report on any known issues here in real time, so it is the best first place to check if your team experiences any issues, to save time before submitting a Helpdesk email.

### Commissioning new development work

*Please note bugs are not dealt with in this manner, instead they have their own (escalated) procedure. See the 'Email based Helpdesk' section*.

Here is a step by step illustration of the life cycle of a requirement from inception by a partner (such as a credit union) through to Viva IT delivery and going live on the Apollo platform:

* The requirement begins as **a commercial requirement submitted to helpdesk@vivait.co.uk by the partner**, summed up with a brief description. At this stage the detail can be very light. Examples might include 'Wanting a new loan form' or 'changes to an existing form', or 'something that will let people recommend the app to their friends'. 

* An appropriate **Viva IT team member will be in touch** to discuss the development with the partner. At this stage the goal is still ascertaining their commercial intent - not to worry too much about technical implementation.

* Once the partners Viva IT contact has discussed and understood the requirement, they will either work with you to **gather key underpinning information** and take the requirement to the Viva IT technical team to establish the feasibility and magnitude of the requirement.

* Once no further information is required, the **request will be added to the backlog of works** the partner has waiting until they prioritize it on a subsequent monthly Apollo Infinity call. 

* Once **scheduled in for development by mutual agreement**, the works are undertaken and you will be asked to test the resulting work. See the 'User Acceptance' section below for more detailed information. In short this phase involves the partner 'checking' and 'signing off' the work as completed to agreed specification.

### Collaboration with 'Youtrack'

https://youtrack.vivait.co.uk is our task tracking and coordinating software. We use this to sort development works and programmes into discrete tasks with defined beginnings and ends. This is where administration regarding items on your development to-do list are stored, as well as all relevant communications on a given issue.  

We grant our partners access to this tool to enable effective collaboration. Usually access will be granted to a key operational stakeholder on our partners side. The basic commands are easy to learn and you will be guided through in a process that takes approximately 20-30 minutes including tutorial.

### User Acceptance Testing 

User Acceptance Testing -  also known as 'UAT' - is the description of a state of a piece of development work undergoing testing by our commissioning partner, and we seek their approval. Any work which does not gain approval in timely fashion must be either 'fixed' to match the previously agreed specification, or 'undone'.  

A designated stakeholder on the partners side will be responsible for coordinating feedback from their organisation during UAT and being a singular 'voice of the customer' although the testing itself may be conducted by many individuals on the partners side, depending on the nature of the work. 

Timescales for UAT on works should be expected in accordance with the plans created at previous Apollo Infinity Monthly meetings, which should ensure partner availability to provide testing and feedback.  

A typical 'UAT' exchange will firstly involve Viva IT explaining which works have been undertaken and how to test these. 

In response, the partner will submit their feedback.

Following this, the process either ends, and the task is considered 'resolved' or certain changes are made (which must be retested after implementation).

UAT feedback cycles normally take a week in total, and if feedback is not received during this time the work will be undone and require future scheduling. For this reason we coordinate with stakeholders to ensure their work is undertaken when they have capability to test.

Youtrack is used as the coordinating medium for UAT feedback, along with partner responses to automated emails.

### Avoiding Scope Creep

Our approach to development involves iterating on existing work in discrete increments. Therefore all of the work we undertake has predetermined criteria at for being considered 'done' which are established from the outset when work specifications are created and 'signed off' with our partners.

It is completely natural and common for the 'next steps' or future phases of development to appear self evident once initial developments are deployed and in use on a given project, however new requirements after development is underway will always be treated as new tasks and scheduled in separately. 

We will also likely encourage larger projects to be broken down into more manageable increments for a phased deployment approach. These restrictions are to prevent the following scenarios from occurring:

* A mammoth project being specified up front which turns out to be unfit for purpose once it is eventually delivered.
* Problems scheduling in work of undefined or changing magnitude inevitably resulting in partner let-down.
* Hastily altered requirements being poorly considered and specified due to bypassing standard specification phases, and causing unforeseen impacts on the partners.

Those partners who have been involved in any kind of project management will no doubt be familiar of a myriad of other issues which can occur with poorly defined project scopes. 

We will provide expertise to help break down even the most mammoth of deliverables into manageable chunks, methodically considered and delivered on time to an agreed schedule. To achieve this we need partner help and understanding in applying a disciplined approach to the User Acceptance Testing phase of all deliverables, in particular resisting the temptation to use 'UAT' as a vehicle for unplanned specification changes.

The ongoing Apollo Infinity time all partners are entitled to allow new tasks to be created and scheduled to finesse existing works.

### Monthly Apollo Infinity meetings

Once a month you will have the a one-on-one meeting with your account manager to maintain the Apollo programme of works for your organisation. 

As well as housekeeping (such as keeping abreast of staff changes), topics will include agreed development workload and prioritisation to progress and customise your Apollo implementation. 

Participating in these meetings ensures you get the maximum value out of your Infinity time and allows the next months Infinity time to be scheduled. In January for example, we will be discussing the work you require for completion by end of February providing it is fully specified at the time of discussion.

### Backlog prioritisation

Included in your Apollo Infinity package you will have a certain amount of development time included per month.

How you spend this time is up to you, and may include minor tweaks or major projects spaced out over time. It is important that both partner stakeholders and Viva IT agree on the top few priorities at any given time, as we will work strictly in the order agreed.

The only exceptions are bugs and related Helpdesk problems which may be worked on in parallel (and may not even deduct from your available Infinity time). 

Viva IT likes to work with one or two stakeholders only to establish priorities during the monthly Apollo Infinity meeting for the avoidance of confusion. 

### Timescales

4-6 weeks from fully specifying a requirement until development.

Escalations are available upon request, at additional cost due to the scheduling impacts this causes. Please contact a member of our team to discuss your specific requirement.

Helpdesk tickets are always reviewed promptly and triaged based upon issue severity and number of users affected. Issues which directly impact members are usually picked up within minutes.

UAT responses from partners are desired within 24 hours where possible, within 7 days at a maximum.

Apollo Infinity meetings are conducted monthly.
